When testing your program, the `assert` function will validate whether an expected result matched the program's output.

In today's class exercise, you'll learn how to use the `assert` function to ensure that a node was inserted into a binary search tree properly. First, create a program that creates three nodes with the values 5, 3, and 10 (in that order) and inserts them into a binary search tree. Feel free to use the example code from our [class repository](https://github.com/ajdillhoff/CSE1320-Examples/tree/main/binary_trees).
